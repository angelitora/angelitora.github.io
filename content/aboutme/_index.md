### About me
<p align="justify">
I am currently an Associate Professor in Physical Oceanography at the Institute of Earth Sciences within the University of Iceland (Háskóli Íslands). Prior to this position I worked as a Research Scientist at the Icelandic Meteorological Office (Veðurstofa Íslands) and before that I was an Associate Professor at the <a href="https://www.atmosfera.unam.mx/"> Instituto de Ciencias de la Atmósfera y Cambio Climático, UNAM, México </a>.</p>
<p align="justify">
I am a Physical Oceanographer with lots of Geophysical Fluid Dynamics ideas. I did my Undergraduate studies at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México with Roberto Zenit and then my MSc and PhD at Caltech with Melany Hunt, followed by a Postdoctoral Research Fellow position at LDEO of Columbia University with Andreas M. Thurnherr. </p>
