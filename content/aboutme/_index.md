### About me
<p align="justify">
I am currently an Associate Professor in Physical Oceanography at the Institute of Earth Sciences within the University of Iceland (H√°sk√≥li √çslands). Prior to this position I worked as a Research Scientist at the Icelandic Meteorological Office (Ve√∞urstofa √çslands) and before that I was an Associate Professor at the <a href="https://www.atmosfera.unam.mx/"> Instituto de Ciencias de la Atm√≥sfera y Cambio Clim√°tico, UNAM, M√©xico </a>.</p>
<p align="justify">
I am a Physical Oceanographer with lots of Geophysical Fluid Dynamics ideas. I did my Undergraduate studies at the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico with Roberto Zenit, Masters and PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Caltech with Melany Hunt, followed by a Postdoctoral Research Fellow position in Physical Oceanography at LDEO of Columbia University with Andreas M. Thurnherr. </p>

I spend most of my free time cooking, biking (cycling) and baking. I love hosting taco parties üåÆüåÆ :hot_pepper: at Little Mexico (our house).</p>
